"content"  : "This theme was created using the Google’s Polymer 1.0. It’s currently a first draft, so there are still features I plan to add and fix. (See the Github repository for details.)I created this theme because I couldn’t figure out how to set up a Jekyll project to play nicely with Polymer, and because I didn’t find any Jekyll blog themes available that used Polymer or followed Google’s material design specifications.Structure  app/: Contents of the site, following the Jekyll structure. Put your blog content here.          elements/: Custom web components using Polymer      scripts/: Javascript. Will be minimized when built.      styles/: Custom CSS. CSS used here will be minimized when built.        bower_components: Content installed via bower goes here  node_modules: Content installed via npm goes hereBuild InstructionsThis part is pretty brutal right now but gets the job done. Hopefully I’ll get better with gulp and clean this up soon.For now, just use Jekyll to build and serve. The gulp stuff doesn’t really work yet."

"content"  : "StackEdit stores your documents in your browser, which means all your documents are automatically saved locally and are accessible offline!  NOTE:      StackEdit is accessible offline after the application has been loaded for the first time.    Your local documents are not shared between different browsers or computers.    Clearing your browser’s data may delete all your local documents! Make sure your documents are backed up using Google Drive or Dropbox synchronization (see  Synchronization section).   Create a documentYou can create a new document by clicking the  button in the navigation bar. It will switch from the current document to the new one. Switch to another documentYou can list all your local documents and switch from one to another by clicking the  button in the navigation bar. Rename a documentYou can rename the current document by clicking the document title in the navigation bar. Delete a documentYou can delete the current document by clicking the  button in the navigation bar. Save a documentYou can save the current document to a file using the  Save as... sub-menu from the  menu.  Tip: See  Publish a document section for a description of the different output formats.SynchronizationStackEdit can be combined with Google Drive and Dropbox to have your documents centralized in the Cloud. The synchronization mechanism will take care of uploading your modifications or downloading the latest version of your documents.  NOTE:      Full access to Google Drive or Dropbox is required to be able to import any document in StackEdit.    Imported documents are downloaded in your browser and are not transmitted to a server.    If you experience problems exporting documents to Google Drive, check and optionally disable browser extensions, such as Disconnect.   Import a documentYou can import a document from the Cloud by going to the  Google Drive or the  Dropbox sub-menu and by clicking Import from.... Once imported, your document will be automatically synchronized with the Google Drive / Dropbox file. Export a documentYou can export any document by going to the  Google Drive or the  Dropbox sub-menu and by clicking Export to.... Even if your document is already synchronized with Google Drive or Dropbox, you can export it to a another location. StackEdit can synchronize one document with multiple locations.  Tip: Using Google Drive, you can create collaborative documents to work in real time with other users. Just check the box Create a real time collaborative document in the dialog options when exporting to Google Drive. Synchronize a documentOnce your document is linked to a Google Drive or a Dropbox file, StackEdit will periodically (every 3 minutes) synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. Any conflict will be detected, and a local copy of your document will be created as a backup if necessary.If you just have modified your document and you want to force the synchronization, click the  button in the navigation bar.  NOTE: The  button is disabled when you have no document to synchronize. Manage document synchronizationSince one document can be synchronized with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking  Manage synchronization in the  menu. This will open a dialog box allowing you to add or remove synchronization links that are associated to your document.  NOTE: If you delete the file from Google Drive or from Dropbox, the document will no longer be synchronized with that location.PublicationOnce you are happy with your document, you can publish it on different websites directly from StackEdit. As for now, StackEdit can publish on Blogger, Dropbox, Gist, GitHub, Google Drive, Tumblr, WordPress and on any SSH server. Publish a documentYou can publish your document by going to the  Publish on sub-menu and by choosing a website. In the dialog box, you can choose the publication format:  Markdown, to publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (GitHub for instance),  HTML, to publish the document converted into HTML (on a blog for instance),  Template, to have a full control of the output.  NOTE: The default template is a simple webpage wrapping your document in HTML format. You can customize it in the Services tab of the  Settings dialog. Update a publicationAfter publishing, StackEdit will keep your document linked to that publish location so that you can update it easily. Once you have modified your document and you want to update your publication, click on the  button in the navigation bar.  NOTE: The  button is disabled when the document has not been published yet. Manage document publicationSince one document can be published on multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking  Manage publication in the  menu. This will open a dialog box allowing you to remove publication links that are associated to your document.  NOTE: In some cases, if the file has been removed from the website or the blog, the document will no longer be published on that location.Markdown ExtraStackEdit supports Markdown Extra, which extends Markdown syntax with some nice features.  Tip: You can disable any Markdown Extra feature in the Extensions tab of the  Settings dialog.TablesMarkdown Extra has a special syntax for tables:            Item      Value                  Computer      1600 USD              Phone      12 USD              Pipe      1 USD      You can specify column alignment with one or two colons:            Item      Value      Qty                  Computer      1600 USD      5              Phone      12 USD      12              Pipe      1 USD      234      Definition ListsMarkdown Extra has a special syntax for definition lists too:  Term 1  Term 2  Definition A  Definition B  Term 3      Definition C        Definition D          part of definition D      Fenced code blocksGitHub’s fenced code blocks1 are also supported with Prettify syntax highlighting:// Foovar bar = 0;FootnotesYou can create footnotes like this2.SmartyPantsSmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into “smart” typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:                   ASCII      HTML                  Single backticks      &#39;Isn&#39;t this fun?&#39;      ‘Isn’t this fun?’              Quotes      &quot;Isn&#39;t this fun?&quot;      “Isn’t this fun?”              Dashes      -- is an en-dash and --- is an em-dash      – is an en-dash and — is an em-dash      CommentsUsually, comments in Markdown are just standard HTML comments. StackEdit extends HTML comments in order to produce useful, highlighted comments in the preview but not in your exported documents. MathJaxYou can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using MathJax, as on math.stackexchange.com:There are inline equations like ( y = x + 2 ) indicated by ( ... ).You can also display an equation (not inline displayed) using inline code, like [ y = x + 4] which you do with [ ... ].The Gamma function satisfying ( Gamma(n) = (n-1)!quadforallninmathbb N ) is via the Euler integral  Tip: Make sure you include MathJax into your publications to render mathematical expression correctly. Your page/template should include something like:&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://stackedit.io/libs/MathJax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;  NOTE: You can find more information:      about Markdown syntax here,    about Markdown Extra extension here,    about LaTeX mathematical expressions here,    about Prettify syntax highlighting here,    about Highlight.js syntax highlighting here.              GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) is supported by StackEdit. &amp;#8617;              Here is the text of the footnote. &amp;#8617;      "

This is a block quote.It’s split over multiple lines.  It can also have multiple paragraphs.Math (with MathJax)You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using MathJax, as on math.stackexchange.com:There are inline equations like ( y = x + 2 ) indicated by ( ... ).You can also display an equation (not inline displayed) using inline code, like [ y = x + 4] which you do with [ ... ].Or you can display a block of math by surrounding it with $$ ... $$. Like this:  Tip: Make sure you include MathJax into your publications to render mathematical expression correctly. Your page/template should include something like:&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://stackedit.io/libs/MathJax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;CodeInline codeCode embedded in a paragraph looks like this is code. Code can also be in blocks with or without line numbers.Code blocks (fenced code)Code blocks have syntax highlighting courtesy of highlight.js. You can specify the code language and whether you want the code block to include line numbers. (You can include line numbers using just linenos instead of linenos=table, but this puts the line numbers in the same lines as the code so that it becomes impossible to copy and paste.)With line numbers (as table):12345def print_hi(name)    puts &amp;quot;Hi, #{name}&amp;quot;  end  print_hi(&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;)  #=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT. This is a long line to test scrolling and wrapping in code.Without line numbers:def print_hi(name)    puts &amp;quot;Hi, #{name}&amp;quot;  end  print_hi(&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;)  #=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT. This is a long line to test scrolling and wrapping in code.With line numbers (inline):1 def print_hi(name)2     puts &amp;quot;Hi, #{name}&amp;quot;3   end4   print_hi(&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;)5   #=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT. This is a long line to test scrolling and wrapping in code.Definition ListsMarkdown Extra has a special syntax for definition lists too:  Term 1  Term 2  Definition A  Definition B  Term 3      Definition C        Definition D          part of definition D      DividersDivide up sections and stuff with dividers.They look like that.Font weights and stylesThis text is bold text.This is italicized text.Links and FootnotesYou can create footnotes like this1.You can embed links with a direct link, like this link to Google. Links can also be in a separated form like this link to the Jekyll documention. (That’s useful if you want to link to the same website multiple times like this.)
